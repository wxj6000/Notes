3.1 Introduction and Transport-layer services
	- Logical communication: it is as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected;
	- The IP service model is a best-effort delivery service. This means that IP makes its “best effort” to deliver segments between communicating hosts, but it makes no guarantees.
	- TCP: reliable data transfer, congestion control

3.2 Multiplexing and demultiplexing
	- Demultiplexing: delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket.
	- Multiplexing: The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information (that will later be
	used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and assing the segments to the network layer.
	
	1. Sockets have unique identifiers
	2. Segment have speical fields: source port number field, destination port number field

3.3 UDP: connectionless transport
	- there is no handshaking between sending and receiving transport-layer entities before sending a segment
	- Cons: Finer application-level control over what data is sent, and when;No connection establishment; No connection state; Small packet header overhead.
	
3.4 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer
	- FSM: finite-state machine
	- Rdt1.0: perfectly reliable channel
	- Rdt2.0: channel with bit errors, with ack
	- Rdt2..1:ack was corrupted
	- Rdt3.0: a lossy channel with bit errors
	- SR: selective repeat

3.5 Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP
	- Handshake
	- Full-duplex service, point-to-point transfer
	- Plus, sequence number field, ack field, receive window, header length field, options field, flag field
	- Doubling the timeout interval, fast retransmit
	- Flow-control service: congestion control

3.6 Principles of congestion control
	- Available bit-rate(ABR) services in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
	
3.7 TCP congestion control
	- slow start
	- congestion avoidance
	- fast recovery
  - AIMD: additive-increase, multiplicative-descrease
