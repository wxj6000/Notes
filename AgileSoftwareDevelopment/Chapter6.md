It's pretty good to have unit tests. I worked in three companies. And only one of them were required to write unit tests. And this one request comes directly from cto who wants to have coverage 100%, previously 0%. So the developers spent one month to write all the unit tests. In the meantime, users change requirement weekly, which constantly break all the unit tests. Aslo one of the developers in the team, he likes to refactor the code and not re-write any unit tests. This is a really bad experience to me. He refactors codes without notice and constantly break my codes. Also, unit tests cannot guarantee passing refactoring.
