# The agile alliance
## Individuals and interactions / processes and tools

- Team communication is the most important
- Team can start from a free tool and expand later
    - well, a lot companies do LAMP (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL relationship database, PHP programing language)

## Working Software / comprehensive documentation

- Documentation:
    - Short: one or two dozen pages at most
    - Salient: discuss overall design rationale and only the highest-level structures in the system
- Better to have human-to-human interaction if new team member comes.
- Produce no document unless its need is immediate and significant

## Cusomer collaboration / contract negotiation
- Requirement changes over time

## Responding to change / following a plan
- Better to have weekly meeting to discuss with customer
- Roadmap is also good to have

# Extreme Programming
- Customer Team Memeber
    - Easy to contact your customer

- User Stories
     - Planning tool for customer to schedule the implementation of a requirement based upon its priority and estimated cost.

- Short Cycles
    - Two-week, iteration plan
    - Three months, release plan

- Acceptance Tests
    - Quality Assurance (QA)

- Pair Programming
    - One is typing and the other one watches
    - Role can be change
    - Spread of knowledge throught the team! (like this one)

- TDD Test-Driven Developmenet
    - Good for Refactoring
    - Need to decouple the modules

- Collective Ownership
    - Everybody has ownership of every code (emm... this is new to me)

- Continuous Integration
    - CI/CD is the best!

- Sustainable Pace
    - Steady, moderate pace

- Open Workspace
- The Planning Game
    - Scoring Fibonacci
    - Add user stories up
- Simple Design
    - Consider the simplest thing that could possible work (don't over-engineer)
    - You aren't going to need it
    - Once and only once - clean code

- Refactoring
- Metaphor
    - Big picture that ties the whole system together

# Planning
## Initial Exploration
- Spiking, Splitting, and Velocity
    - Merge small stories
    - split larger one
    - Spike: prototype session
- Release Planning
    - Give customer flavor of velocity of each story, let them decide sprint planning
- Iteration Planning
    - Sprint Frequency: two-week usually
- Task Planning
    - All about budgets!
    - The halfway
- Iterating
    - Two-week
    
# Testing
- More an act of design than of verification
- More an act of documentation than of verfication
- TDD
    - Conveniently callable
    - Testable
    - Decouple the software

- How to
    - Mock object pattern
- Acceptance tests
    - white-box tests: unit test
    - black-box tests: usually end-to-end? QA perform
    - automated! of course!

# Refactoring
- LOL, well, "if it's not broken, don't fix it"
- A whole book is talking about it!
